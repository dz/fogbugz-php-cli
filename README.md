# FogBugz Command Line Client

A simple command line client application that can be used to manage your FogBugz
account, working on status, read cases, and leave short notes. This is built
using the [Symfony Console][sc].

## Quick Start

Run the `fb` phar file from the command line. It will prompt you for host, user,
and password. It will store an API token in a .fogbugz.yml file.

## Setup

You don't have to clone this repo. You can [download the phar file][dlfb] and save it
to your computer as `fb`.

This app stores a config file with host, user, an api token and other
settings. If you'd like to change this path, set a env var for
`FOGBUGZ_CONFIG` for a value such as `~/.fogbugz.yml` to store the
config file in you home directory. 

    env FOGBUGZ_CONFIG='~/.fogbugz.yml'

You can either locate the `fb` phar file in a bin
path, or add an alias to your bash config for the file

    alias fb='~/Projects/fogbugz-php-cli/fb'

## Dependencies

This app requires PHP 5.3. If you need to run on PHP 5.2, you can use the [older
cli branch](https://github.com/there4/fogbugz-php-cli/tree/php-5.2) that has 
fewer depencies, but similar basic functionality.

## Developing New Commands

The project depends on [Composer][composer] to load dependencies. Once you've
got that, run `composer install` to load the the required libraries. From this
point, you should be able to develop by running `php working.php`.

If you'd like to add new commands to the repo, see the `src/FogBugz/Command`
directory. After creating a new command file, add it to the 
`src/FogBugz/Cli/Working.php` file around line 50 where we init the commands.

## Building the Phar

If you'd like to rebuild the phar file, you'll need [Pake][pake]. Once you've
got that, you'll need to run `pake build`. It will clean the files, run some
linters, and then finally build the phar file.

## Troubleshooting

* `date_default_timezone_get())` : Some users are getting messages about system
  timezones. This is a problem with your php config. Please see the 
  [PHP Docs][date] for information about fixing this message.
