This is built\r\nusing the [Symfony Console][sc].\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\n[Download the .phar file](https://github.com/there4/fogbugz-php-cli/blob/master/fb?raw=true)\r\nand save it locally. Add the path to your bin.\r\n\r\nRun the `fb` phar file from the command line. It will prompt you for host, user,\r\nand password. It will store an API token in a .fogbugz.yml file.\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\n    FogBugz Command Line Client version 1.0.4 by Craig Davis\r\n    \r\n    Usage:\r\n      [options] command [arguments]\r\n    \r\n    Options:\r\n      --help           -h Display this help message.\r\n      --quiet          -q Do not output any message.\r\n      --verbose        -v Increase verbosity of messages.\r\n      --version        -V Display this application version.\r\n      --ansi              Force ANSI output.\r\n      --no-ansi           Disable ANSI output.\r\n      --no-interaction -n Do not ask any interactive question.\r\n    \r\n    Available commands:\r\n      cases       Show the cases for the current filter\r\n      current     Display the current working case\r\n      estimate    Set a the working estimate for a case\r\n      filters     List filters for the current user\r\n      help        Displays help for a command\r\n      list        Lists commands\r\n      login       Establish a session with FogBugz\r\n      logout      End the session with FogBugz\r\n      note        Leave a note on a case\r\n      open        Open a case in your local browser\r\n      parent      View a Parent Case\r\n      ps1         Display the current working case\r\n      recent      Show cases you've recently worked on.\r\n      resolve     Resolve a case\r\n      search      Search by keyword\r\n      setfilter   Set a FogBugz search filter\r\n      setup       Configure this FogBugz client\r\n      start       Start working on a case\r\n      stop        Stop your current working case.\r\n      version     Show version information\r\n      view        View a Case\r\n    \r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nThis app stores a config file with host, user, an api token and other\r\nsettings. If you'd like to change this path, set a env var for\r\n`FOGBUGZ_CONFIG` for a value such as `~/.fogbugz.yml` to store the\r\nconfig file in you home directory. \r\n\r\n    env FOGBUGZ_CONFIG='~/.fogbugz.yml'\r\n\r\nYou can either locate the `fb` phar file in a bin\r\npath, add an alias to your bash config for the file\r\n\r\n    alias fb='~/Projects/fogbugz-php-cli/fb'\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis app requires PHP 5.3. If you need to run on PHP 5.2, you can use the [older\r\ncli branch](https://github.com/there4/fogbugz-php-cli/tree/php-5.2) that has \r\nfewer depencies, but similar basic functionality.\r\n\r\n## Development TODO\r\n\r\n* Resolve: select the destination user from a list\r\n* Login: Test auth token and re-auth on failure\r\n* Setup: Validate the host url with an api touch\r\n* New [Self Update][update] command.\r\n* Cases: Display the name of the current filter as a heading\r\n* Consider Kiln [branch commands][kiln]\r\n\r\n## Developing New Commands\r\n\r\nThe project depends on [Composer][composer] to load dependencies. Once you've\r\ngot that, run `composer install` to load the the required libraries. From this\r\npoint, you should be able to develop by running `php working.php`.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to add new commands to the repo, see the `src/FogBugz/Command`\r\ndirectory. After creating a new command file, add it to the \r\n`src/FogBugz/Cli/Working.php` file around line 50 where we init the commands.\r\n\r\n## Building the Phar\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to rebuild the phar file, you'll need [Pake][pake]. Once you've\r\ngot that, you'll need to run `pake build`. It will clean the files, run some\r\nlinters, and then finally build the phar file.\r\n\r\n[sc]: http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html\r\n[composer]: http://getcomposer.org/\r\n[pake]: https://github.com/indeyets/pake/wiki\r\n[kiln]: https://developers.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W166\r\n\r\n[update]: https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Command/SelfUpdateCommand.php"}
