{"name":"Fogbugz Command Line Client","tagline":"Command line interface for FogBugz","body":"[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/there4/fogbugz-php-cli.png)](http://travis-ci.org/there4/fogbugz-php-cli)\r\n\r\n# FogBugz Command Line Client\r\n\r\nA simple command line client application that can be used to manage your FogBugz\r\naccount, working on status, read cases, and leave short notes. This is built\r\nusing the [Symfony Console][sc].\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nRun the `fb` phar file from the command line. It will prompt you for host, user,\r\nand password. It will store an API token in a .fogbugz.yml file.\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\n    FogBugz Command Line Client version 1.1.4 by Craig Davis\r\n    \r\n    Usage:\r\n      [options] command [arguments]\r\n    \r\n    Options:\r\n      --help           -h Display this help message.\r\n      --quiet          -q Do not output any message.\r\n      --verbose        -v|vv|vvv Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug\r\n      --version        -V Display this application version.\r\n      --ansi              Force ANSI output.\r\n      --no-ansi           Disable ANSI output.\r\n      --no-interaction -n Do not ask any interactive question.\r\n    \r\n    Available commands:\r\n      cases        Show the cases for the current filter\r\n      current      Display the current working case\r\n      estimate     Set a the working estimate for a case\r\n      filters      List filters for the current user\r\n      help         Displays help for a command\r\n      list         Lists commands\r\n      login        Establish a session with FogBugz\r\n      logout       End the session with FogBugz\r\n      note         Leave a note on a case\r\n      open         Open a case in your local browser\r\n      parent       View a Parent Case\r\n      ps1          Display the current working case\r\n      recent       Show cases you've recently worked on.\r\n      resolve      Resolve a case\r\n      search       Search by keyword\r\n      selfupdate   Updates fb.phar to the latest version.\r\n      setfilter    Set a FogBugz search filter\r\n      setup        Configure this FogBugz client\r\n      start        Start working on a case\r\n      stop         Stop your current working case.\r\n      version      Show version information\r\n      view         View a Case\r\n    \r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nYou don't have to clone this repo. You can [download the phar file][dlfb] and save it\r\nto your computer as `fb`.\r\n\r\nThis app stores a config file with host, user, an api token and other\r\nsettings. If you'd like to change this path, set a env var for\r\n`FOGBUGZ_CONFIG` for a value such as `~/.fogbugz.yml` to store the\r\nconfig file in you home directory. \r\n\r\n    env FOGBUGZ_CONFIG='~/.fogbugz.yml'\r\n\r\nYou can either locate the `fb` phar file in a bin\r\npath, or add an alias to your bash config for the file\r\n\r\n    alias fb='~/Projects/fogbugz-php-cli/fb'\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis app requires PHP 5.3. If you need to run on PHP 5.2, you can use the [older\r\ncli branch](https://github.com/there4/fogbugz-php-cli/tree/php-5.2) that has \r\nfewer depencies, but similar basic functionality.\r\n\r\n## Development TODO\r\n\r\n* Resolve: select the destination user from a list\r\n* Login: Test auth token and re-auth on failure\r\n* Setup: Validate the host url with an api touch\r\n* Consider Kiln [branch commands][kiln]\r\n\r\n## Developing New Commands\r\n\r\nThe project depends on [Composer][composer] to load dependencies. Once you've\r\ngot that, run `composer install` to load the the required libraries. From this\r\npoint, you should be able to develop by running `php working.php`.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to add new commands to the repo, see the `src/FogBugz/Command`\r\ndirectory. After creating a new command file, add it to the \r\n`src/FogBugz/Cli/Working.php` file around line 50 where we init the commands.\r\n\r\n## Building the Phar\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to rebuild the phar file, you'll need [Pake][pake]. Once you've\r\ngot that, you'll need to run `pake build`. It will clean the files, run some\r\nlinters, and then finally build the phar file.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n* `date_default_timezone_get())` : Some users are getting messages about system\r\n  timezones. This is a problem with your php config. Please see the \r\n  [PHP Docs][date] for information about fixing this message.\r\n\r\n\r\n[date]: http://us3.php.net/date_default_timezone_get\r\n[dlfb]: https://github.com/there4/fogbugz-php-cli/raw/master/fb\r\n[sc]: http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html\r\n[composer]: http://getcomposer.org/\r\n[pake]: https://github.com/indeyets/pake/wiki\r\n[kiln]: https://developers.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W166\r\n\r\n[update]: https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Command/SelfUpdateCommand.php\r\n","google":"UA-8504376-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
